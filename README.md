# SLO-Fundus-Cup-and-Disc-Segmentation

In this project, two deep learning based segmentation models are implemented to segment the optical disc and cup in the Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (SLO) fundus images. FairSeg dataset is used for both training and testing of the models. The images are gray scale images. Finally, overall dice score is calculated. Also, dice score for different races, gender and ethnicity  are also calculated separately for the analysis of the fairness for each segmentation model.
